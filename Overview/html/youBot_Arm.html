<h2 id="1">Model</h2>
<p>The top level of the model contains hyperlinks that configure the model according to the test you wish to perform. The default test is for the entire system (robot arm and conveyor belts).</p>
<p>Box transfer tests can be run to determine the amount of power required for a specific manipulator trajectory.</p>
<p>Joint tests can be run to determine required motor torque and the forces that the bearings will experience.</p>
<img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="youBot_Arm_01.png" alt=""> <h2 id="2">Arm Subsystem</h2>
<p>This subsystem includes the robot arm which was imported from CAD software, the joint actuators, and the environment surrounding the robot. Hyperlinks at this level configure the robot joints to use prescribed motion (<b>Motion</b>), or modeled as a connected electrical network (<b>Motor</b>). Motion actuation is typically used to determine torque requirements for the motor, and based on those requirements the motors in the electrical network can be selected.</p>

<p>This variant includes the robot arm joints which were imported from CAD. They have been configured to use prescribed motion, where the angle for the joint is specified by an input signal.

<p>This variant includes the electrical network which provides the power to actuate each joint. The joint definitions were imported from a CAD assembly.</p>
<p>The actuators can be configured to use prescribed motion and estimate the current draw (<b>Ideal</b>), or the joints can be driven by electrical motors (<b>Motor</b>). Clicking on the hyperlinks will change multiple motors at the same time.

<p>This variant is used to determine the requirements for the electrical system. The joints are driven using prescribed motion, and the simulation calculates the torque required to produce this motion. The radial and axial forces for the motor bearings are also calculated for each joint. This information is useful to refine the requirements for the motor.</p>
<p>This variant also estimates the amount of electrical power required to produce this motion using the actuation torque. Each joint draws current from the power supply, making it possible to determine the requirements for power connections and the supply. The current estimation used here requires selecting a gear ratio, motor torque constant, and an armature resistance. The absolute value of the actuation torque is used because though the actuation torque can switch sign, current is always drawn from the power supply.</p>

<p>This subsystem models the environment surrounding the robot arm. It includes two conveyor belts and a load.</p>
<p>Hyperlinks at this level configure the connection between the gripper and the load. Clicking on hyperlink <b>Payload</b> will assume the load is rigidly attached to the gripper. Hyperlinks <b>Damping</b> and <b>Penalty</b> each model a contact force between the gripper and the load at two levels of fidelity. Clicking on these hyperlinks adjusts variant subsystems <i>Load</i> and <i>Gripper Force</i> simultaneously to ensure the selected variants are compatible. These settings are selected based on the test that is performed. The only one that should be overriden manually is switching between variants <tt>Damper</tt> and <tt>Penalty</tt> for the <i>Gripper Force</i> subsystem when the <tt>Box</tt> variant is selected for the <i>Load</i> subsystem.</p>

</p>
<img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="youBot_Arm_09.png" alt=""> <h2 id="10">Belt In Subsystem</h2>
<p>This subsystem models the conveyor belt, contact force between the box and the belt, and the light curtain at the end of the belt.</p>
<p>The conveyor belt is driven at speed vx. The motor driving the belt is not modeled. The rollers rotate to simply give a visual indication that the belt is on.</p>
<p>The contact force is active if the upper or lower surface of the belt encounters the bottom face of the box. The calculated normal force is used to model a sensor that will detect if a box is on the belt. This signal is sent to the supervisory logic controller for the system. The only difference between Belt In and Belt Out is in the contact force - in Belt Out, the contact force is modeled between the belt and the top face of the box.</p>
<p>The light curtain detects if the box is blocking any of its beams and sends a signal to the logic controller.</p>
<p>Transform Sensor EE measures the x-y-z position of the end effector and saves it to the workspace. This quantity is used for plotting purposes, both during normal desktop simulation and it is saved during the optimization tests to show the set of trajectories tested.</p>

<img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="youBot_Arm_10.png" alt=""> <h2 id="11">Gripper Force Subsystem</h2>
<p>This subsystem shows the three variants for the gripper force. These variants are selected using the hyperlinks one level higher in the model or by using the hyperlinks at the top level that configure the test.</p>

</p>
<img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="youBot_Arm_11.png" alt=""> <h2 id="12">Gripper Force Subsystem, Damper Variant</h2>
<p>This subsystem models the contact force between the gripper and the box as a very stiff damper that is only active when the box is grasped by the gripper fingers. The force subsystem measures the displacement between a reference frame on the gripper and the box to determine if the gripper could grab the box. If it can, the damper becomes active.</p>
<p>This is an abstract representation of the force. The simplifying assumptions is computationally very efficient. It assumes the box will slip very, very slowly with respect to the gripper. It does not consider the exact geometry of the fingers or the gripper itself - a misaligned box can be grasped using this force.</p>
<p>There are two methods for measuring the velocity of the box along the normal of the gripper fingers. One measures it with respect to a reference frame on the gripper housing. The other takes the difference of relative velocity with respect to each finger, allowing the box to move relative to the gripper housing.</p>

</p>
<img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="youBot_Arm_12.png" alt=""> <h2 id="13">Gripper Force Subsystem, Penalty Variant</h2>
<p>This subsystem models the contact force between the gripper and the box as a stiff spring-damper between multiple points on the gripper finger and a square surface on the box. This requires more computation, but is a more realistic way to model the contact force. It can model cases where the box and the gripper are misaligned.</p>

</p>
<img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="youBot_Arm_13.png" alt=""> <h2 id="14">Input Subsystem</h2>
<p>This variant subsystem configures the inputs to the robot arm system. The variants are configured to permit unit testing of individual components of the system.</p>
<p>The <b>Control</b> variant implements the supervisory logic for the entire system. The <b>Signals</b> variant is an open loop test that can actuate any or all of the joints and the conveyor belts. The <b>Splines</b> variant is used to test trajectories for transferring the box from one belt to the other. The <b>Control Belt</b> variant permits closed loop testing of the conveyor belts and open loop testing of the robot arm.</p>
<p>

</p>
<img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="youBot_Arm_14.png" alt=""> <h2 id="15">Logic Subsystem</h2>
<p>This state chart implements the supervisory logic for the robot arm, robot gripper, and both conveyor belts. Information from sensors in the model come in as input signals, and outputs from the state chart will control movement of the robot arm and conveyor belts. During simulation, the state chart is animated to show the active state in each chart.</p>
<p>All four state charts are interconnected. Events in one state chart trigger actions in others. For example, in state chart <b>BeltIn</b>, when the light curtain on the belt is blocked, input <tt>BeltIn_LC=0</tt>. That condition permits the <b>BeltIn</b> state chart to transition to state <i>BoxReady</i>. As the BeltIn state chart transitions to state <i>BoxReady</i>, the belt will be turned off (BeltIn_En=0). The event <b>GetBox</b> will be broadcast to state chart <b>Robot</b>, which causes that state chart to transition from <b>StartHome</b> or <b>Home</b> to <b>GoBeltIn</b>. Entering state <b>GoBeltIn</b> sets output <tt>Way</tt>, which controls the commands sent to the robot joints.</p>

% the load.  Clicking on hyperlink *Payload* will assume the load is
% rigidly attached to the gripper.  Hyperlinks *Damping* and *Penalty* each
% model a contact force between the gripper and the load at two levels of
% fidelity.  Clicking on these hyperlinks adjusts variant subsystems _Load_
% and _Gripper Force_ simultaneously to ensure the selected variants are
% compatible.  These settings are selected based on the test that is
% performed.  The only one that should be overriden manually is switching
% between variants |Damper| and |Penalty| for the _Gripper Force_ subsystem
% when the |Box| variant is selected for the _Load_ subsystem.

%% Belt In Subsystem
%
% This subsystem models the conveyor belt, contact force between the box
% and the belt, and the light curtain at the end of the belt.
%
% The conveyor belt is driven at speed vx. The motor driving the belt is
% not modeled.  The rollers rotate to simply give a visual indication that
% the belt is on.
%
% The contact force is active if the upper or lower surface of the belt
% encounters the bottom face of the box.  The calculated normal force is
% used to model a sensor that will detect if a box is on the belt.  This
% signal is sent to the supervisory logic controller for the system.  The
% only difference between Belt In and Belt Out is in the contact force - in
% Belt Out, the contact force is modeled between the belt and the top face
% of the box.
%
% The light curtain detects if the box is blocking any of its beams and
% sends a signal to the logic controller.
%
% Transform Sensor EE measures the x-y-z position of the end effector and
% saves it to the workspace.  This quantity is used for plotting purposes,
% both during normal desktop simulation and it is saved during the
% optimization tests to show the set of trajectories tested.

%% Gripper Force Subsystem
%
% This subsystem shows the three variants for the gripper force.  These
% variants are selected using the hyperlinks one level higher in the model
% or by using the hyperlinks at the top level that configure the test.

%% Gripper Force Subsystem, Damper Variant
%
% This subsystem models the contact force between the gripper and the box
% as a very stiff damper that is only active when the box is grasped by the
% gripper fingers.  The force subsystem measures the displacement between a
% reference frame on the gripper and the box to determine if the gripper
% could grab the box.  If it can, the damper becomes active.
%
% This is an abstract representation of the force.  The simplifying
% assumptions is computationally very efficient.  It assumes the box will
% slip very, very slowly with respect to the gripper.  It does not consider
% the exact geometry of the fingers or the gripper itself - a misaligned
% box can be grasped using this force.
%
% There are two methods for measuring the velocity of the box along the
% normal of the gripper fingers.  One measures it with respect to a
% reference frame on the gripper housing.  The other takes the difference
% of relative velocity with respect to each finger, allowing the box to
% move relative to the gripper housing.

%% Gripper Force Subsystem, Penalty Variant
%
% This subsystem models the contact force between the gripper and the box
% as a stiff spring-damper between multiple points on the gripper finger
% and a square surface on the box.  This requires more computation, but is
% a more realistic way to model the contact force.  It can model cases
% where the box and the gripper are misaligned.

%% Input Subsystem
%
% This variant subsystem configures the inputs to the robot arm system.
% The variants are configured to permit unit testing of individual
% components of the system.
% 
% The *Control* variant implements the supervisory logic for the entire
% system.  The *Signals* variant is an open loop test that can actuate any
% or all of the joints and the conveyor belts.  The *Splines* variant is
% used to test trajectories for transferring the box from one belt to the
% other.  The *Control Belt* variant permits closed loop testing of the
% conveyor belts and open loop testing of the robot arm.

%% Logic Subsystem
%
% This state chart implements the supervisory logic for the robot arm,
% robot gripper, and both conveyor belts.  Information from sensors in the
% model come in as input signals, and outputs from the state chart will
% control movement of the robot arm and conveyor belts.  During simulation,
% the state chart is animated to show the active state in each chart.
%
% All four state charts are interconnected.  Events in one state chart
% trigger actions in others.  For example, in state chart *BeltIn*, when the
% light curtain on the belt is blocked, input |BeltIn_LC=0|. That condition
% permits the *BeltIn* state chart to transition to state _BoxReady_. As the
% BeltIn state chart transitions to state _BoxReady_, the belt will be turned
% off (BeltIn_En=0). The event *GetBox* will be broadcast to state chart
% *Robot*, which causes that state chart to transition from *StartHome* or
% *Home* to *GoBeltIn*. Entering state *GoBeltIn* sets output |Way|, which
% controls the commands sent to the robot joints.
