%% youBot Arm
%
% This examples models a robotic arm and two conveyor belts.  One conveyor
% belts bring blocks to the robot.  The robot grabs the block, flips it
% over and transfers it to another conveyor belt which transports it away
% from the robot.  
%
% This example can be used to determine requirements for electrical and
% mechanical design, detect integration issues, design and test control
% logic, and optimize path planning.

%% Model
% 
% The top level of the model contains hyperlinks that configure the model
% according to the test you wish to perform. The default test is for the
% entire system (robot arm and conveyor belts).  
% 
% Box transfer tests can be run to determine the amount of power required
% for a specific manipulator trajectory.
% 
% Joint tests can be run to determine required motor torque and the forces
% that the bearings will experience.

%% Arm Subsystem
%
% This subsystem includes the robot arm which was imported from CAD
% software, the joint actuators, and the environment surrounding the robot.
% Hyperlinks at this level configure the robot joints to use prescribed
% motion (*Motion*), or modeled as a connected electrical network
% (*Motor*).  Motion actuation is typically used to determine torque
% requirements for the motor, and based on those requirements the motors in
% the electrical network can be selected.

%% Actuation Subsystem, Motion Variant
%
% This variant includes the robot arm joints which were imported from CAD.
% They have been configured to use prescribed motion, where the angle for
% the joint is specified by an input signal.  The simulation calculates the
% torque required to produce this motion.  The radial and axial forces for
% the motor bearings are also calculated for each joint.  This information
% is useful to refine the requirements for the motor, gear boxes, and the
% mechanical requirements for the bearings.

%% Actuation Subsystem, Motor Variant
%
% This variant includes the electrical network which provides the power to
% actuate each joint. The joint definitions were imported from a CAD assembly. 
% 
% The actuators can be configured to use prescribed motion and estimate the
% current draw (*Ideal*), or the joints can be driven by electrical motors
% (*Motor*).  Clicking on the hyperlinks will change multiple motors at the
% same time.  The motors can be configured individually (*Ideal* or *Motor*) by
% right-clicking on the block and overriding the subsystem variant.  This
% permits very focused testing on individual joints or joint combinations.

%% Forearm Motor Actuation, Ideal Variant
%
% This variant is used to determine the requirements for the electrical
% system.  The joints are driven using prescribed motion, and the
% simulation calculates the torque required to produce this motion.  The
% radial and axial forces for the motor bearings are also calculated for
% each joint.  This information is useful to refine the requirements for
% the motor.
%
% This variant also estimates the amount of electrical power required to
% produce this motion using the actuation torque.  Each joint draws current
% from the power supply, making it possible to determine the requirements
% for power connections and the supply.  The current estimation used here
% requires selecting a gear ratio, motor torque constant, and an armature
% resistance.  The absolute value of the actuation torque is used because
% though the actuation torque can switch sign, current is always drawn from
% the power supply.

%% Forearm Motor Actuation, Motor Variant: Motor - Joint Interface
%
% This variant actuates the robot arm joints using an electrical actuator.
% At this level, the connection between the motor and the robot joint is
% shown.  
%
% This variant does not use prescribed motion.  Torque provided by the
% electrical model of the motor is applied to the joint.  The rotational
% speed of the electrical motor and joint are forced to be identical during
% simulation to ensure that the physics is accurate.

%
% This subsystem models the motor controller, motor drive circuit, motor,
% gearbox, and motor friction.  Parameter values for the motor are taken
% directly from manufacturer data sheets (see
% <matlab:matlab.desktop.editor.openAndGoToLine(which('youBot_PARAM.m'),103); model parameters>).

%% Forearm Motor Actuation, Motor Variant: Motor Control
%
% This subsystem implements the control system for the motor.  A simple
% bang-bang controller based on position error is used. A deadzone prevents
% chattering in the system.  More complex control algorithms can be
% substituted here.

%% Environment Subsystem
%
% This subsystem models the environment surrounding the robot arm.  It
% includes two conveyor belts and a load.
%
% Hyperlinks at this level configure the connection between the gripper and
% the load.  Clicking on hyperlink *Payload* will assume the load is
% rigidly attached to the gripper.  Hyperlinks *Damping* and *Penalty* each
% model a contact force between the gripper and the load at two levels of
% fidelity.  Clicking on these hyperlinks adjusts variant subsystems _Load_
% and _Gripper Force_ simultaneously to ensure the selected variants are
% compatible.  These settings are selected based on the test that is
% performed.  The only one that should be overriden manually is switching
% between variants |Damper| and |Penalty| for the _Gripper Force_ subsystem
% when the |Box| variant is selected for the _Load_ subsystem.

%% Belt In Subsystem
%
% This subsystem models the conveyor belt, contact force between the box
% and the belt, and the light curtain at the end of the belt.
%
% The conveyor belt is driven at speed vx. The motor driving the belt is
% not modeled.  The rollers rotate to simply give a visual indication that
% the belt is on.
%
% The contact force is active if the upper or lower surface of the belt
% encounters the bottom face of the box.  The calculated normal force is
% used to model a sensor that will detect if a box is on the belt.  This
% signal is sent to the supervisory logic controller for the system.  The
% only difference between Belt In and Belt Out is in the contact force - in
% Belt Out, the contact force is modeled between the belt and the top face
% of the box.
%
% The light curtain detects if the box is blocking any of its beams and
% sends a signal to the logic controller.
%
% Transform Sensor EE measures the x-y-z position of the end effector and
% saves it to the workspace.  This quantity is used for plotting purposes,
% both during normal desktop simulation and it is saved during the
% optimization tests to show the set of trajectories tested.

%% Gripper Force Subsystem
%
% This subsystem shows the three variants for the gripper force.  These
% variants are selected using the hyperlinks one level higher in the model
% or by using the hyperlinks at the top level that configure the test.

open_system('youBot_Arm/Arm/Environment/Gripper Force','force')

%% Gripper Force Subsystem, Damper Variant
%
% This subsystem models the contact force between the gripper and the box
% as a very stiff damper that is only active when the box is grasped by the
% gripper fingers.  The force subsystem measures the displacement between a
% reference frame on the gripper and the box to determine if the gripper
% could grab the box.  If it can, the damper becomes active.
%
% This is an abstract representation of the force.  The simplifying
% assumptions is computationally very efficient.  It assumes the box will
% slip very, very slowly with respect to the gripper.  It does not consider
% the exact geometry of the fingers or the gripper itself - a misaligned
% box can be grasped using this force.
%
% There are two methods for measuring the velocity of the box along the
% normal of the gripper fingers.  One measures it with respect to a
% reference frame on the gripper housing.  The other takes the difference
% of relative velocity with respect to each finger, allowing the box to
% move relative to the gripper housing.

%% Gripper Force Subsystem, Penalty Variant
%
% This subsystem models the contact force between the gripper and the box
% as a stiff spring-damper between multiple points on the gripper finger
% and a square surface on the box.  This requires more computation, but is
% a more realistic way to model the contact force.  It can model cases
% where the box and the gripper are misaligned.

%% Input Subsystem
%
% This variant subsystem configures the inputs to the robot arm system.
% The variants are configured to permit unit testing of individual
% components of the system.
% 
% The *Control* variant implements the supervisory logic for the entire
% system.  The *Signals* variant is an open loop test that can actuate any
% or all of the joints and the conveyor belts.  The *Splines* variant is
% used to test trajectories for transferring the box from one belt to the
% other.  The *Control Belt* variant permits closed loop testing of the
% conveyor belts and open loop testing of the robot arm.

%% Logic Subsystem
%
% This state chart implements the supervisory logic for the robot arm,
% robot gripper, and both conveyor belts.  Information from sensors in the
% model come in as input signals, and outputs from the state chart will
% control movement of the robot arm and conveyor belts.  During simulation,
% the state chart is animated to show the active state in each chart.
%
% All four state charts are interconnected.  Events in one state chart
% trigger actions in others.  For example, in state chart *BeltIn*, when the
% light curtain on the belt is blocked, input |BeltIn_LC=0|. That condition
% permits the *BeltIn* state chart to transition to state _BoxReady_. As the
% BeltIn state chart transitions to state _BoxReady_, the belt will be turned
% off (BeltIn_En=0). The event *GetBox* will be broadcast to state chart
% *Robot*, which causes that state chart to transition from *StartHome* or
% *Home* to *GoBeltIn*. Entering state *GoBeltIn* sets output |Way|, which
% controls the commands sent to the robot joints.
